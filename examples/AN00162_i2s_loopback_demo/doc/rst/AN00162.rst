Overview
--------

Introduction
............

The XMOS I\ :sup:`2`\ S library provides software defined, industry-standard,
I\ :sup:`2`\ S (Intergrated Interchip Sound) components that allows you to
stream audio between devices using xCORE GPIO ports.

I\ :sup:`2`\ S is a specific type of PCM digital audio communication using
a bit clock line, word clock line and at least one multiplexed data line.

The library includes features such as I\ :sup:`2`\ S master, I\ :sup:`2`\ S slave,
and TDM master components. This application note uses the
library to create an I\ :sup:`2`\ S master digital loopback.

The application fits entirely within one logical core. The I\ :sup:`2`\ S, GPIO,
and I2C drivers are all time-multiplexed with the loopback application.


I\ :sup:`2`\ S loopback demo
----------------------------

The Makefile
............

To start using the I\ :sup:`2`\ S, you need to add ``lib_i2s`` to you Makefile::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_i2s ...

This demo also uses the I2C library (``lib_i2c``) and the GPIO library
(``lib_gpio``). The I2C library is used to configure the
audio codecs. The GPIO library abstracts the use of a 4-bit port to
drive four individual reset and select lines. So the Makefile also
includes::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_gpio lib_i2c ..


Includes
........

All XC files which declare the application ``main()`` function need
to include ``platform.h``. XMOS xCORE specific defines for declaring
and initialising hardware are defined in ``xs1.h``.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include <platform.h>
   :end-on: include <xs1.h>

The I\ :sup:`2`\ S library functions are defined in ``i2s.h``. This header must
be included in your code to use the library.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include <i2s.h>
   :end-on: include <gpio.h>

The other two includes give access to the I2C and GPIO library functions
which this application note relies on.


Allocating hardware resources
.............................

An I\ :sup:`2`\ S interface requires both clock and data pins in order to
communicate with the audio codec device. On an xCORE
the pins are controlled by ``ports``. The ports used by the I\ :sup:`2`\ S
library are declared on the tile they reside and with their
direction and buffered nature. This loopback application uses
four 1-bit ports for input and four more for output:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: out buffered port:32 p_lrclk
   :end-on: in buffered port:32 p_din

The xCORE also provides ``clock block`` hardware to efficiently generate
clock singal that can either be driven out on a port or used
to control a port. In this application two clocks blocks are used:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: clock mclk
   :end-on: clock bclk

The other ports declared are used by the I2C library to configure
the audio codecs and by the application to control reset and
chip select:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: port p_i2c
   :end-on: port p_gpio

The application main() function
...............................

The ``main()`` function in the program sets up the tasks in the application.

Firstly, the ``interfaces`` are declared. In XC interfaces provide a
means of concurrent tasks communicating with each other. In this
application there is an interface for the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master, an interface
for the I2C master and one for the GPIO output.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: interface i2s
   :end-on: interface output

The rest of the ``main`` function starts all the tasks in parallel
using the XC ``par`` construct:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: par {
   :end-before: return 0

This code is starts the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master, the I2C master, the GPIO control
and the loopback application.

Before the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master runs, the system configuration is run and the
master clock is connected from the input port to the clock block and
then started. The I\ :sup:`2`\ S master task then starts and consumes a logical
core on the xCORE device.

The remaining tasks in the ``par`` are marked with the
``[[distribute]]`` attribute. This means they will run on an existing
logical core if possible. In this case they will all share the
one logical core with the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master so this entire application
requires only one core.

Configuring audio codecs
........................

Two audio codecs are used on the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board. A Cirrus
CS5368 for audio input and a Cirrus CS4384 for audio output. These
codecs have to be configured before they can be used. The
``reset_codecs()`` function writes to the appropriate codec registers
to configure them:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: void reset_codecs
   :end-before: [[distributable]]

If porting this application to a different xCORE development board
then this is the function that will have to be modified to configure
the relevant codecs for that board.

The i2s_loopback application
............................

The I\ :sup:`2`\ S loopback task provides the function of a digital loopback
so that all I\ :sup:`2`\ S samples received by the device will be forwarded on.

The task itself is declared as a ``[[distributable]]`` function
ensuring that it can share a logical core with other tasks. This
is an XC feature of any task that is of the form::

  ...
  while(1) {
    select {
      ...
    }
  }

The function takes a number of arguments:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: [[distributable]]
   :end-on: mclk_select

The interface to the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master is a callback interface that the
I\ :sup:`2`\ S master will call over when it has received data or is ready to
send data.

The I2C interface is used to configure the codecs and the GPIO
interfaces abstract the outputting of single-bit values on a multi-bit
port.

|newpage|

The body of the loopback task handles the I\ :sup:`2`\ S interface calls:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: int32_t samples
   :end-before: static char

The I\ :sup:`2`\ S master library calls the ``init()`` method before it starts
any data streaming. This allows the application to reset and configure
the audio codecs.

The ``receive()`` interface method is called when the master has
received an audio sample on the channel specified by ``index``. The sample
is stored in the ``samples`` array.

The ``send()`` interface method is called when the master needs a new
sample to send on the specified channel. The ``->`` symbol shows
the return value expected from this call. In this case the application
simply returns the current sample on that channel.

Finally, the ``restart_check()`` method is called by the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master
once per frame and allows the application to control restart or
shutdown of the I\ :sup:`2`\ S master. In this case the application continues to
run forever and so always returns ``I2S_NO_RESTART``.

Demo hardware setup
-------------------

The demo is designed to run on the xCORE-200 MC Audio board. To run the
demo:

 * Connect the XTAG-2 or XTAG-3 USB debug adapter to the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board.
 * Connect the XTAG-2 or XTAG-3 to the host PC using USB extension cable.
 * Connect a sound source to the 3.5mm line in. Channels 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 or 7-8 can be used.
 * Connect headphones or speakers to the corresponding line out.
 * Connect the 12V power adaptor to the xCORE-200 MC AUDIO board.

Launching the demo device
-------------------------

Once the application source code is imported into the tools it can
be built by pressing the :menuitem:`Build` button in the
xTIMEcomposer. This will create the ``AN00162_i2s_loopback_demo.xe``
binary in the ``bin`` folder of the project. xTIMEcomposer may
have to import the dependent libraries if you do not already have them
in your workspace; this will occur automatically on build.

A *Run Configuration* then needs to be set up. This can be done by
selecting the :menuitem:`Run,Run Configurations...` menu. You can
create a new run configuration by right clicking on the
:menuitem:`xCORE application` group in the left hand pane and
:menuitem:`New`.

Select your XMOS XTAG in the Target box and click **Apply**. You can
now click the **Run** button to launch the application.

The audio from the input should now be playing on the corresponding output channel.
All 8 channels should be active.

Alternatively, the command line tools can be used to build and run the application.
Building is done by changing to the folder containing the ``src`` sub-folder and
doing a call to ``xmake``. Running the application is then done using
``xrun bin/AN00162_i2s_loopback_demo.xe``.
